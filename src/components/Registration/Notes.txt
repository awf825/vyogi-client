In these files I have moved some things around for the registration of users.  
I npm installed react-hook-form, and react-icons. 
The react-icons was used just to spruce up some of the components looks.
The react-hook-form is being used to handle the login and sign up logic.  It makes it much cleaner and easier to use.
The documentation for this library is fantastic.  
The modal works very well.  There is a warning in the console but that is because of the Strict mode tags around the App component in the index.  
I haven't tested trying to create or login as a user yet. I'm a little confused on the logic for the login/signup so I'll let you look it over first before I redo anything.
I also have all the styles inline right now.  I can change these in the future just wanted basic styles.


NOTE!
    THE MODAL FOR LOGIN AND SIGN UP WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU COME FROM THE NAV LINK OR GO TO /registration FIRST!


Let me know what you think!

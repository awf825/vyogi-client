          My first experience with yoga was all the way back in elementary
          school when I found a Rodney Yee DVD at the mall and decided to give
          it a try. From that point on I dabbled here and there, but once I hit
          high school found that I was intimidated by the competitive
          environment of many yoga studios. It wasn’t until a couple years ago,
          when I was living in New York City, that I began to practice seriously
          again. I turned to yoga as a way to calm down in the hectic
          environment, and <i>this</i> time it really stuck! I decided that yoga
          had such a positive impact on my wellbeing that I had to share it with
          others. Drawn to the Kripalu style due to its emphasis on compassion
          and inclusiveness, I headed to the Kripalu Center in Stockbridge MA to
          get my 200 hour certification. I believe yoga is for everybody
          regardless of size, age, background, or athletic ability and I try to
          live and teach by Swami Kripalu’s words: “The highest form of
          spiritual practice is self-observation without judgement.” When I’m
          not practicing yoga, I spend time cooking, reading, playing piano,
          (attempting) to learn new languages, or watching Real Housewives.
